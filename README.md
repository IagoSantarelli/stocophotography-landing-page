# StocoPhotography Landing Page

This repository contains a simple landing page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

The page now includes a hero section and a top navigation bar for quick access to its main sections.

## Development

1. Edit files in the `src` directory for TypeScript code.
2. Run `npx tsc` to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the landing page.
